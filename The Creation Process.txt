As there have been some elaborate steps taken to develop the assets and tools necessary to make this mod a reality, I'm providing a (hopefully) brief overview of how this mod was made. I'll be covering three parts: creating the raw image portrait files, converting the raw images to the proper format, and editing the scena (scenario) files.

To start, this mod includes portraits from three separate sources: Ao no Kiseki (also known as Trails to Azure), Akatsuki no Kiseki (a Trails gacha title never released in English), and the great work of [YuzuKiyochii](https://twitter.com/YuzuKiyochii). The Azure portraits were sourced from the Geofront version of Azure, so it was possible to directly port those back into Zero with no other modifications necessary.

For the Akatsuki images, though, this process was not as straightforward. Rather than each portrait being stored in a separate file, Akatsuki stores one large image per character:

This meant that there were no portraits that could be drag-and-dropped into the game--portraits would have to be manually created. First, an AI image upscaler was used to increase the resolution of these images.

Here's a comparison of the original image with the upscaled version--the improvements in image quality should be self-evident.

These upscaled images were of high enough quality to use as the base for the portraits.
